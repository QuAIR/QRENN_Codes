## Overview 
This is a Github repository for the academic research of 'Quantum Recurrent Embedding Neural Networks (QRENN)' describing a new design of quantum neural network design.
- **Context:**  
  Focusing on the quantum supervised learning problems in the domain of quantum neural networks (QNNs) and qnantum machine learning (QML).
- **Key Findings:**  
  1. We design a new QNN model in the framework of quantum data reuploading, based on the advanced quantum algorithm design, e.g., quantum singular value transformation (QSVT).
  2. We theoretically showcase that the model can avoid barren plateaus issue in quantum supervised learning tasks.
  3. We numerically showcase that QRENN model can be applied in Hamiltonian classification and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) detection tasks.
- **Paper:**  
  arXiv version: [Quantum Recurrent Embedding Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13185).
